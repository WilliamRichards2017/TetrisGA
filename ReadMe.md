This project aims to create a good controller for Tetris. 
It also aims to create an AI for Tetris that makes the games as difficult as possible.
We do this using the HyperNEAT neural network and genetic algorithm.
We also are creating our own tetris interface to play the game, 
which allows for manual play (with graphics) as well as fast simulation (without graphics).
